                        <br>
                        Data Governance allows fine-grained access to resources based on user privileges. Post
                        authentication, user can interact with the system to manage data visibility by blinding or
                        unblinding specific attributes. The application is developed in Spring Boot and Angular.
                        It uses PingFederate SSO system for user authentication & Amazon Red Shift DB for
                        data storage and manipulation.

                        <br>

                        in JBoss
                        <br>
                        5. Designed an exception handling mechanism using Spring AOP for centralized
                        exception management with custom error responses
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        CAM (Centralized Access Management) is a microservice that was proposed to Pfizer
                        clinical supply & distribution team (PCSD). Its primary objectives are to simplify
                        existing complexities & improve latency in the Impala 2 system. The application uses
                        PingFederate SSO system, Spring Security and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise application
                        server platform.
                        CAM takes client request using REST API and augments it with additional processable
                        information. AES encryption/decryption techniques are utilized for request/response to
                        Impala 2 system. For system stability, it employs rate limiting techniques to manage
                        incoming requests.

                        additional permissions
                        <br>
                        2. Inducted role-based restrictions for study level users & Pfizer users (without system level
                        permissions)
                        <br>
                        3. Created REST service for disabling users, fetching user details like User Id, User roles
                        (study, system, site)
                        <br>
                        4. Designed permission management API to retrieve permission list from
                        ImpalaPermissionService, add distinct and unique permissions, delete & patch
                        permissions

                        <strong>Project Title: CLE (Client: CVS Health Corporation - Aetna HealthCare)</strong>
                        <br>
                        Automated Claim Adjudication System (ACAS) is a mainframe application used for
                        processing health insurance claims including dental, hospital, and medical claims. The
                        system utilizes COBOL for backend processing, DB2 as the database, and CICS
                        (Customer Information Control System) for the frontend interface. ACAS integrates
                        with various upstream and downstream applications to ensure seamless operations.
                        Claim Line Expansion (CLE) a subproject under ACAS, was initiated to enhance the
                        system's capabilities. CLE extended the ability to process expense/service lines from 18
                        to 99 and increased the override capacity from 45 to 999. Additionally, it expanded the
                        amount processing capacity from one billion to 100 billion.
                        <br>

                        including CLI, CQC, HC, CP, DC, PF 20, EXT-CLI, HI and AS leveraging SDF2 utility
                        <br>
                        2. Worked extensively towards the CLI/CQC/AS screen modernization: -
                        <br>
                        a) Enhanced existing search functionality in CLI & CQC screen by identifying
                        recurring pattern
                        <br>
                        b) Introduced new scrolling and pagination logic for the CLI, CQC, PF 20, EXT-CLI, AS, PD
                        screens

                    <strong>Project</strong>
                    <br>
                    <strong>E-Commerce Website</strong>
                <p>
                    Developed a full-stack e-commerce web application, building both the frontend and backend to create
                    a complete online shopping experience. For the frontend, I utilized Angular, along with TypeScript,
                    Bootstrap, and CSS, to design a dynamic and responsive user interface. This included implementing
                    core functionalities like a shopping cart, secure login/logout features, and access control to
                    protect sensitive user data.

                    A strong emphasis was placed on security, which led me to integrate Okta for secure user
                    authentication and authorization. I implemented the Okta Sign-In Widget for a seamless login/logout
                    process and leveraged the Okta Authorization Server with Java Spring Boot to develop secure REST API
                    endpoints. I ensured robust security by implementing industry-standard protocols such as JWT,
                    OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SSL/TLS to protect user data and transactions.

                    The backend, which I constructed using Java Spring Boot, provided a scalable and secure RESTful API.
                    I used Spring Data JPA repositories and Spring Data REST to streamline data management and Lombok to
                    reduce boilerplate code. I also implemented features like dynamic product search by category,
                    pagination, and secure HTTPS communication to enhance the user experience and application
                    performance. Secure credit card processing was integrated via the Stripe API, including automated
                    email receipts, with data stored in a MySQL database.

                    Throughout the development process, I utilized modern tools such as IntelliJ, VS Code, Postman,
                    Maven, and npm to ensure efficient code development, testing, and deployment.
